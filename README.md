## Program to write code

Jupyter Notebook is great for interactive coding. But you can also write code in a regular program for your computer, such as:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the extension [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.python)
* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/)

All programs are free to use and works with Mac, Windows and Linux. Use Visual Studio Code if you can't decide.
