# JU2602 Data journalism and visualization

This page contain Python code and Jupyter Notebooks for the course JU2602 Data journalism and visualization, part of the [master programme in investigative journalism at JMG, Sweden](http://utbildning.gu.se/education/courses-and-programmes/program_detail/?programid=S2JOU).

The goal is to learn the basics of programming in general and Python in particular. No previous programming knowledge is required. The goal is to build a news robot that can scrape the web and automatically write a news article.

***Please bring your computer!***

Contact [Peter M. Dahlgren](http://jmg.gu.se/om-institutionen/personal?userId=xdpete&languageId=100001) if you have any questions.

## Overview

Overview of what we'll do, apart from the lectures:

1. Install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads/) (choose Python version 3+) that contains Python and Jupyter Notebooks.
2. Get familiar with Jupyter Notebooks.
3. Do the exercises.
4. Learn to control program flow with `ìf`-statements and `for`-loops.
5. Write fuctions with `def` that group code into reusable blocks.
6. End with some bigger web scraping projects: e.g., news robot.

## Exercises

Exercise | Goal
:---------------- | :---------------------------------------
[Exercise 1: Variables](/Exercises/1-variables.md) | Create, change and combine variables.
[Exercise 2: Strings](/Exercises/2-strings.md) | Manipulate text strings.
[Exercise 3: If-statements](/Exercises/3-if-statements.md) | Control program flow with if, elif and else.
[Exercise 4: For-loops](/Exercises/4-for.md) | Use for-loops to control how lists are presented on the screen.
[Exercise 5: Functions (def)](/Exercises/5-def.md) | Create functions that take input, change the input, and then return some new value.
[Exercise 6: Error handling](/Exercises/6-errors.md) | Understand common error messages, and how to solve them.

## Projects

Project | Description
:---------------- | :---------------------------------------
[Web Scraping Examples](/2%20Web%20scraping%20and%20APIs/Web%20scraping%20and%20Exercise.ipynb) | Example code for scraping Internet Movie Database, Washington Post and Wikipedia.
[Model Scraper](/Projects/model-scraper.ipynb) | Student project that scrape body measurements from women models.
[BeautifulSoup Examples](/3%20News%20robot/Scraping%20examples.ipynb) | Example code to help you scrape HTML from web pages using BeautifulSoup. 
[Earthquake News Robot](/3%20News%20robot/Earthquake%20news%20robot.ipynb) | News robot that writes a news article based on (fictitious) earthquake data.
[Weather News Robot](/3%20News%20robot/Weather%20news%20robot.ipynb) | News robot that scrapes tomorrows weather and writes a short text complaining about how cold it is.

## Jupyter Notebooks - keyboard shortcuts

- **`Ctrl+Enter`** = run cell
- **`ESC`** = exit out of a cell
- **`Tab`** = autocomplete
- **`a`** = insert cell above
- **`b`** = insert cell below
- **`dd`** = delete cell

Jupyter Notebook files are saved on your computer in your home directory, typically in in your Users folder (i.e., `/Users/<username>`). Read more at [28 Jupyter Notebook tips, tricks and shortcuts](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tips-tricks-shortcuts/).

## Learn more about Python

### Learn Python

There are plenty of guides online that will teach you programming in Python. Codecademy is interactive, which means that you can write code directly in your browser and see if it works as you go along with the lectures.

## Program to write code

Jupyter Notebook is great for interactive coding. But you can also write code in a regular program for your computer, such as:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the extension [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.python)
* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/)

All programs are free to use and works with Mac, Windows and Linux. Use Visual Studio Code if you can't decide.
