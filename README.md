# JU2602 Data journalism and visualization

This page contain Python code and Jupyter Notebooks for the course JU2602 Data journalism and visualization, part of the [master programme in investigative journalism at JMG, Sweden](http://utbildning.gu.se/education/courses-and-programmes/program_detail/?programid=S2JOU).

The goal is to learn the basics of programming in general and Python in particular. No previous programming knowledge is required. The goal is to build a news robot that can scrape the web and automatically write a news article.

***Please bring your computer!***

Contact [Peter M. Dahlgren](http://jmg.gu.se/om-institutionen/personal?userId=xdpete&languageId=100001) if you have any questions.

## Overview

Overview of what we'll do, apart from the lectures:

1. Install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads/) (choose Python version 3+) that contains Python and Jupyter Notebooks.
2. Get familiar with Jupyter Notebooks.
3. Do the exercises.
4. Learn to control program flow with `if`-statements and `for`-loops.
5. Write fuctions with `def` that group code into reusable blocks.
6. End with some bigger web scraping projects: e.g., news robot.

## Exercises

Exercise | Goal
:---------------- | :---------------------------------------
[Exercise 1: Variables](/Exercises/1-variables.md) | Create, change and combine variables.
[Exercise 2: Strings](/Exercises/2-strings.md) | Manipulate text strings.
[Exercise 3: If-statements](/Exercises/3-if-statements.md) | Control program flow with if, elif and else.
[Exercise 4: For-loops](/Exercises/4-for.md) | Use for-loops to control how lists are presented on the screen.
[Exercise 5: Functions (def)](/Exercises/5-def.md) | Create functions that take input, change the input, and then return some new value.
[Exercise 6: Error handling](/Exercises/6-errors.md) | Understand common error messages, and how to solve them.

## Jupyter Notebooks - keyboard shortcuts

- **`Ctrl+Enter`** = run cell
- **`ESC`** = exit out of a cell
- **`Tab`** = autocomplete
- **`a`** = insert cell above
- **`b`** = insert cell below
- **`dd`** = delete cell

Jupyter Notebook files are saved on your computer, typically in your Users folder (i.e., `/Users/<username>`). Read more at [28 Jupyter Notebook tips, tricks and shortcuts](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tips-tricks-shortcuts/).
